# TrackMeOrNot

TrackMeOrNot is a web browser that enables users to selectively share their online footprints with vendors (trackers) while shielding privacy sensitive browsing activities from trackers.

TrackMeOrNot is implemented on Chromium (version 45.0.2426.3).

A user of TrackMeOrNot can specify URL policies and category policies as her/his tracking preference.
All navigations in TrackMeOrNot start with an anonymous browsing context.
The machine learning model in TrackMeOrNot automatically determines the topic of the content that the user is visiting.
Based on the user's tracking preference, TrackMeOrNot can seamlessly switch to or stay in the expected browsing context (persistent or anonymous) to meet user's privacy need.

You can find more information about TrackMeOrNot in our [WWW 2016 research paper](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei/papers/www16_trackmeornot.pdf). Please reference our paper when using TrackMeOrNot or our data set. The BibTeX format file is provided with the source code.

## Build Instructions

The steps to building TrackMeOrNot are similar to those to building Chromium. You only need to sync with the version of Chromium on which TrackMeOrNot was implemented and apply two GIT patches. The full instruction for building Chromium could be found [here](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code).

1. Set up the environment
You need to install the *depot_tools* package first. [Instructions](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)
  ```
  mkdir chromium
  cd chromium
  ```

2. Fetch the Chromium source code
  ```
  fetch --nohooks chromium
  ```

3. Install dependencies
  1. On Linux:
    ```
    sudo ./build/install-build-deps.sh
    ```

  2. On Mac, please see the [instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/mac_build_instructions.md).


4. Check out to the track-me-or-not branch
  ```
  cd src
  git checkout -b track-me-or-not 45.0.2426.3
```

5. Sync with version 45.0.2426.3
  ```
  gclient sync --with_branch_heads --jobs 16
  ```

6. Apply Chromium patch
  ```
  git apply ../../patches/trackmeornot_chromium.patch
  ```

7. Apply WebKit patch
  ```
  cd third_party/WebKit
  git apply ../../../../patches/trackmeornot_webkit.patch
  ```

8. Run post-sync hooks
  ```
  cd ../../
  gclient runhooks
  ```

9. Build Chromium
  ```
  ninja -C out/Release chrome
  ```

10. Run TrackMeOrNot
  1. On Linux
    ```
    TRACKING_CONTROL=1 out/Release/chrome
    ```

  2. On Mac OS X
    ```
    TRACKING_CONTROL=1 out/Release/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
    ```

## Data Set

Please find details about the data set used in our WWW 2016 research paper in the research project page.

## Classification Model

We built 78 binary classifiers using the LinearSVC algorithm with our data set, which was labeled with [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com).
The classifiers were used for evaluation in our paper.
Since we have not got the permission to release the model learnt from the data set, we do not include the classifiers in the source code release.
Instead, we provide a dummy classificaiton model implementation in our release.
The dummy classification model randomly selects one from the 78 classes as the prediction result.

You could build your own classifiers and integrate with TrackMeOrNot.
The implementation of the dummy classification model could be found in `chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/tmon/`.
